# How to run
To run this proxy first the user must call "make" to create the executable files

Next make sure that the port you want to run the proxy is the same port you are using on your browser

In my case I was able to use Firefox and I altered the network settings
In there click on use "manual proxy configuration" HTTP proxy
Then for HTTP proxy use localhost and the PORT should be what your first argument will be when you run the proxy
In my case I just used 8080

Then once that's set up go to the terminal and run "./proxy <PORT number>" or example "./proxy 8080"
In the console you will be able to see the requested URI when running HTTP links in firefox
In Firefox you should be able to see your requested HTTP link
You will be able to keep running websites unless a socket error occurs

Finally you should be able to see all the requested HTTPs in the proxy.log, since it automatically appends in it after a request
